Title :- Turtle game with Python

Description:-
This Python program uses the turtle module to create a basic game where the player, represented by a turtle on the screen, can move left and right to collect falling stars. 
The stars move down the screen, and when the player's turtle collides with a star, the star is repositioned randomly, simulating collection. The game runs in a continuous loop,
updating the screen and providing an ongoing experience. You can customize and expand the code to add features like scoring or obstacles for a more engaging game. 
The game window remains open until closed by the user.
